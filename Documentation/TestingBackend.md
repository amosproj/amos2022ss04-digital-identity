# Testing Backend

Testing is the process of checking the functionality of an application to ensure it runs as per requirements. Unit testing comes into picture at the developers’ level; it is the testing of single entity (class or method). Unit testing plays a critical role in helping a software company deliver quality products to its customers.

Unit testing can be done in two ways − manual testing and automated testing.


## Why we should have tests

Unit testing ensures that all code meets quality standards before it’s deployed. This ensures a reliable engineering environment where quality is paramount. Over the course of the product development life cycle, unit testing saves time and helps developers write better code, more efficiently.


## Testing Framework: JUnit

### General

JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java programming language. It plays a crucial role test-driven development, and is a family of unit testing frameworks collectively known as xUnit.

JUnit promotes the idea of "first testing then coding", which emphasizes on setting up the test data for a piece of code that can be tested first and then implemented. This approach is like "test a little, code a little, test a little, code a little." It increases the productivity of the programmer and the stability of program code, which in turn reduces the stress on the programmer and the time spent on debugging.

### Features

* JUnit is an open source framework, which is used for writing and running tests.
* Provides annotations to identify test methods.
* Provides assertions for testing expected results.
* Provides test runners for running tests.
* JUnit tests allow you to write codes faster, which increases quality.
* JUnit is elegantly simple. It is less complex and takes less time.
* JUnit tests can be run automatically and they check their own results and provide immediate feedback. There's no need to manually comb through a report of test results.
* JUnit tests can be organized into test suites containing test cases and even other test suites.
* JUnit shows test progress in a bar that is green if the test is running smoothly, and it turns red when a test fails.


### How to install


## General concept for testing

A Unit Test Case is a part of code, which ensures that another part of code (method) works as expected. To achieve the desired results quickly, a test framework is required. JUnit is a perfect unit test framework for Java programming language.

A formal written unit test case is characterized by a known input and an expected output, which is worked out before the test is executed. The known input should test a precondition and the expected output should test a post-condition.

There must be at least two unit test cases for each requirement − one positive test and one negative test. If a requirement has sub-requirements, each sub-requirement must have at least two test cases as positive and negative.
